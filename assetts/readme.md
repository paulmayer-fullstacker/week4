# The Interactive TODO List

## Introduction:

Herewith my submission for Week-4's challenge: an interactive TODO list. The solution comprises: a HTML index page (index.html), a CSS style sheet (style.css), and a Java Script (JS) file (script.js).

The HTML page is sparce, acting only as the entry point for the solution. The CSS style sheet offers sufficient styling to allow some level of [intuitive use*](#note). The JS file defines the functionality of the solution.

Specific solution features are not listed within this document. However, some justification of my solution strategy and JS coding will be offered.
The solution has been pushed to my GitHub repository and published to GitHub Pages, for public access and review.

## The Solution

### Behind the Interactive TODO List:

The main functionality of the interactive to-do list is defined within the JS file. The JS file contains the clinet-side logic, accommodating manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM), and event handling.
The JS file was judiciously commented, during development. The comments offer comprehensive documentation, giving insight into design strategy and component justification. Please refer to the script.js file, as no further explanation will be offered (repeated) here.
